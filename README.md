# Pokemon-CSS-Challenge
I did this project for getting better at visual drawings with Pure-CSS.

I didnt want it to use any drawing API's or librarys because I want it to try my CSS Skills.

WHAT I USED:
-HTML
-BootStrap
-CSS
-jQuery
-Fetch API

.about{
Why its not looking a normal website: This project is not about UI/UX !important;
display: My Skills;
:)
}
